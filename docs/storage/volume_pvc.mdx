# Persistent Volume with Nutanix Volume

Nutanix distributed storage delivers storage using multiple protocols, including Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB), and Internet Small Computer System Interface (iSCSI). Nutanix Volumes is enterprise-class, software-defined storage that exposes storage resources directly to virtualized guest operating systems or physical hosts using the iSCSI protocol.

Nutanix CSI driver provides ReadWriteOnce PV using Volumes. You must first configure a storage container in an AOS cluster with the required storage properties such as deduplication, compression, erasure coding, and thin provisioning.  Nutanix Volumes exposes the provisioned volumes as iSCSI targets
