## Takeaways

NCM Self Service Native Capabilities:

-   **Application Lifecycle Management:** Fully automate the provisioning, scaling, and deletion of both traditional multi-tiered
    applications and modern distributed services using pre-integrated blueprints that make management of applications in private and
    public clouds extremely simple.
-   **Customizable Blueprints:** Simplify the set-up and management of custom enterprise applications by incorporating all elements of each
    app, including relevant VMs, configurations and related binaries, into an easy-to-use-blueprint that is managed by the infrastructure
    team. IT teams can eliminate the hours and days currently devoted to routine application management.
-   **Nutanix Marketplace:** Blueprints can be published directly to end users through the Nutanix Marketplace, giving application owners and
    developers the ability to request IT services that can then be instantly provisioned.
-   **Governance:** Calm maintains control with role-based governance that limits user operations based on permissions. Additionally, all
    activities and changes are centrally logged for end-to-end traceability, aiding security teams with key compliance initiatives.
-   **Hybrid Cloud Management:** Automate the provisioning of Hybrid Cloud architectures, scaling both multi-tiered and distributed
    applications across different cloud environments, including AWS. Calm shows the overall utilization and true cost of your public
    cloud consumption at a glance so that decisions are based on business needs and budget requirements.
