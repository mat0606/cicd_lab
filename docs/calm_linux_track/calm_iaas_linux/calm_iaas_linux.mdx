title: "Calm: Infrastructure as a Service"
---

*The estimated time to complete this lab is 20 minutes.*

# Overview

Nutanix Calm allows you to seamlessly select, provision, and manage your
business applications across your infrastructure for both the private
and public clouds. Nutanix Calm provides App lifecycle, monitoring and
remediation to manage your heterogeneous infrastructure, for example,
VMs or bare-metal servers. Nutanix Calm supports multiple platforms so
that you can use a single self-service and automation interface to
manage all your infrastructure.

Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) is defined as the ability to quickly
provide compute resources, on-demand through a self service portal.
While many customers utilize Nutanix Calm to orchestrate complex,
multi-tiered applications, a significant portion of customers also
utilize Calm to provide basic IaaS for their end users.

**In this lab you'll create a "Single VM Blueprint" based on Linux, launch the blueprint, and manage the resulting application.**

# Creating a Single VM Blueprint

A blueprint is the framework for every application or piece of
infrastructure that you model by using Nutanix Calm. While complex,
multi-tiered applications utilize the \"Multi VM/Pod Blueprint\", the
streamlined interface of the \"Single VM Blueprint\" is conducive for
IaaS use cases. You can model each type of infrastructure your company
utilizes (for instance Windows, CentOS, and/or Ubuntu) in a Single VM
blueprint, and end users can repeatedly launch the blueprint to create
infrastructure on demand. The resulting infrastructure (which is still
referred to as an \"application\"), can then be managed throughout its
entire lifecycle within Calm, including managing Nutanix Guest Tools
(NGT), modifying resources, snapshotting, and cloning.

In this lab, you will be creating a **CentOS 7** Linux server.

1.  In **Prism Central**, select **> Services > Calm**.

    ![](images/1_access_calm.png)

2.  Select ![blueprints](images/blueprints.png) **Blueprints** in the left hand toolbar to view and manage Calm blueprints.

    :::note

    Hovering the mouse over an icon will display its title.
    
    :::

3.  Click **+ Create Blueprint > Single VM Blueprint**.

4.  Fill out the following fields:

    -   **Name** - *Initials*-CentOS-IaaS
    -   **Description** - Something descriptive of your choice
    -   **Project** - *Initials*-Project

    ![CentOS 7 Blueprint Settings](images/2_centos_1.png)

5.  Click **VM Details** to proceed to the next step.

6.  Note the following fields on the **VM Details** page:

    -   **Name** - The internal-to-Calm name of the VM. Can be left as default.
    -   **Cloud** - The cloud we're deploying the infrastructure on **Nutanix**.
    -   **Operating System** - The type of OS we're deploying. It should be left as Linux if you're using CentOS 7, or changed to Windows if using Windows 2016.

    ![Windows 2016 VM Details](images/5_windows_2.png){.align-center}

7.  Click **VM Configuration** to proceed to the next step.

8.  On this page, we'll be specifying a variety of settings for our infrastructure.

    -   **General Configuration**
    -   **VM Name** - this is the name of the virtual machine according to the hypervisor/cloud. It can be left as default.
    -   **vCPUs** - 2 (Mark the field as **runtime** by clicking the running man icon so it turns blue. This allows the end user to modify this field at launch.)
    -   **Cores per vCPU** - 1
    -   **Memory (GiB)** - 4 (Mark this field as **runtime**.)

    ![CentOS 7 VM Configuration - General Configuration](images/6_centos_3.png)

    -   **Guest Customization** - Guest customization allows for the modification of certain settings at boot. Linux OSes use ``Cloud Init``, while Windows OSs use ``Sysprep``. 
        Select the **Guest Customization**, and then paste in the following script.

        -   CentOS 7

            
            cloud-init.sh
            :::

            ![CentOS 7 Cloud Init](images/8_centos_4.png){.align-center}

        ::: note
        ::: title
        Note
        :::

        Take note of the \"@@{vm_password}@@\" text. In Calm the \"@@{\"
        and \"}@@\" characters represent a macro. At runtime, Calm will
        automatically \"patch\" or substitute in the proper value(s)
        when it encounters a macro. A macro could represent a system
        defined value, a VM property, or (as it does in this case) a
        runtime variable. Later in this lab we\'ll create a runtime
        variable with the name \"vm_password\".
        :::

    -   **Disks** - A disk is the storage of the VM or infrastructure
        that we\'re deploying. It could be based on a pre-existing image
        (as it will in our case), or it could be based on a blank disk
        to enable the VM to consume additional storage. For instance, a
        Microsoft SQL server may need its base OS disk, a separate SQL
        Server binary disk, separate database data file disks, separate
        TempDB disks, and a separate logging disk. In our case we\'re
        going to have a single disk, based on a pre-existing image.

        -   **Type** - The type of disk, this can be left as default
            (**DISK**).
        -   **Bus Type** - The bus type of the disk, this can be left as
            default (**SCSI**).
        -   **Operation** - How the disk will be sourced. \"Allocate on
            Storage Container\" is used for blank disks. We\'re going to
            keep the default, **Clone from Image Service**, as we\'re
            using a pre-defined image.
        -   **Image** - The image the VM will be based off of. Select
            **CentOS7.qcow2**.
        -   **Bootable** - Whether or not this particular disk is
            bootable. A minimum of one disk *must* be bootable. In our
            case, leave it **enabled**.

        ![CentOS 7 VM Configuration - Disks](images/10_centos_5.png){.align-center}

    -   **Boot Configuration** - The boot method of the VM. We\'ll leave
        the default of **Legacy BIOS**.

    -   **vGPUs** - Whether or not the VM needs a virtual graphical
        processing unit. We\'ll leave the default of none.

    -   **Categories** - Categories span several different products and
        solutions within the Nutanix portfolio. They enable you to set
        security policies, protection policies, alert policies, and
        playbooks. Simply choose the categories corresponding to the
        workload, and all of these policies will automatically be
        applied. In this lab however, we\'re going to leave this field
        **blank**.

    ![VM Configuration - Boot Configuration, vGPUs, and Categories](images/12_boot_gpu_cat.png){.align-center}

    -   **NICs** - Network adapters allow communication to and from your
        virtual machine. We\'ll be adding a single NIC by clicking the
        **blue plus**, then selecting **Primary** in the dropdown, and
        selecting the **Dynamic** radio button.

    ![VM Configuration - NICs](images/13_vm_nic.png){.align-center}

    -   **Serial Ports** - Whether or not the VM needs a virtual serial
        port. We\'ll leave the default of **none**.

    ![VM Configuration - Serial Ports](images/14_serial.png){.align-center}

9.  At the bottom of the page, click the blue **Save** button. It is
    expected to have a single error about an incorrect macro due to our
    Guest Customization containing \"vm_password\". If you have
    additional errors, please be sure to resolve them before continuing
    to the next section.

    ![Blueprint Save - Error](images/15_error.png){.align-center}

# Defining Variables

Variables allow extensibility of Blueprints, meaning a single Blueprint
can be used for multiple purposes and environments depending on the
configuration of its variables. Variables can either be static values
saved as part of the Blueprint or they can be specified at **Runtime**
(when the Blueprint is launched), as they will in this case.

In a Single VM blueprint, variables can be accessed by clicking the
**App variables** button near the top. By default, variables are stored
as a **String**, however additional **Data Types** (Integer, Multi-line
String, Date, Time, and Date Time) are all possible. Any of these data
types can be optionally set as **Secret**, which will mask its value and
is ideal for variables such as passwords. There are also more advanced
**Input Types** (versus the default **Simple**), however these are
outside the scope of this lab.

Variables can be used in scripts executed against objects using the
**@@{variable_name}@@** construct (called a macro). Calm will expand and
replace the variable with the appropriate value before sending to the
VM.

1.  Click the **App variables** button along the top pane to bring up
    the variables menu.

2.  In the pop-up that appears, you should see a note stating you
    currently do not have any variables. Go ahead and click the blue **+
    Add Variable** button to add our variable, and fill out the
    following fields.

    -   Along the **left column**, click the **running man** icon to
        mark this variable as **runtime**.

    -   In the main pane, set the variable **Name** as **vm_password**.
        This name must *exactly* match (including case) the value within
        our macro from our Guest Customization script, otherwise we\'ll
        continue to get an error when we save.

    -   Leave the **Data Type** as the default, **String**. Feel free to
        investigate the other options, however discussion about them are
        outside the scope of this lab.

    -   For the **Value**, leave blank, as we want the end users to
        specify their own VM password.

    -   **Enable** the **Secret** checkbox, as we do not want this
        password to be visible.

    -   Click the **Show Additional Options** link at the bottom.

    -   Leave the **Label** field blank.

    -   In the **Description** field, paste in **Create a password for
        the user \"centos\"**.

    -   **Enable** the **Mark this variable mandatory** checkbox. This
        will ensure that the end user enters a password, which is
        required since we did not provide default value.

    -   Leave the other two checkboxes unselected.

        ![Variable - vm_password](images/16_variable.png){.align-center}

3.  Scroll to the bottom, and click the blue **Done** button.

4.  Click **Save**. It is expected to receive a **Warning** stating that
    the value of our secret variable is empty. This is needed as there
    is not way to determine the value of a secret once you save the
    blueprint, so this warning alerts a user in the event they
    accidentally left it blank. Warnings do not prevent users from
    launching or publishing the blueprint. If you receive any other
    warning, or a red error, please resolve the issue before continuing
    on.

    ![Blueprint Save - Warning](images/17_warning.png){.align-center}

# Launching the Blueprint

Now that our blueprint is complete, take note of the buttons to the
right of the save button:

-   **Publish** - this allows us to request to publish the blueprint
    into the Marketplace. Blueprints have a 1:1 mapping to a Project,
    meaning only other users who are members of our own Project will
    have the ability to launch this blueprint. Publishing blueprints to
    the Marketplace allows an administrator to assign any number of
    Projects to the Marketplace blueprint, which enables self service
    for any number of end users desired.
-   **Download** - this option downloads the blueprint in a JSON format,
    which can be checked into source control, or uploaded into another
    Calm instance.
-   **Launch** - this launches our blueprint and deploys our application
    and/or infrastructure.

1.  Go ahead and click the **Launch** button, and enter the following:

    > -   **Name of the Application** - *initials*-CentOS-IaaS
    > -   **vm_password** - Nutanix/4u

![Blueprint Launch](images/18_launch.png){.align-center}

1.  Click **Create**, where you\'ll be redirectly the application page.

# Managing your Application

Wait several minutes for your application to change from a
**Provisioning** state to a **Running** state. If it instead changes to
an **Error** state, navigate to the **Audit** tab, and expand the
**Create** action to start troubleshooting your issue.

Once your application is in a **Running** state, navigate around the
five tabs in the UI:

![Application Tabs](images/19_app_tabs.png){.align-center}

-   The **Overview** tab gives you information about any variables
    specified, the cost incurred (showback can be configured in the Calm
    Settings), an application summary, and a VM summary.
-   The **Manage** tab allows you to run actions against the application
    / infrastructure. This includes basic lifecycle (start, restart,
    stop, delete), NGT management (install, manage, uninstall), and App
    Update, which allows for editing of basic VM resources.
-   The **Metrics** tab gives in depth information about CPU, Memory,
    Storage, and Network utilization.
-   The **Recovery Points** tab lists the history of VM Snapshots, and
    allows the user to restore the VM to any of these points.
-   The **Audit** tab shows every action run against the application,
    the time and user that ran a given action, and in depth information
    on the results of that action, including script output.

Next, view the common VM tasks available in the upper right corner of
the UI:

![Application Buttons](images/20_app_buttons.png){.align-center}

-   The **Clone** button allows a user to duplicate the existing
    application into a new app that is manageable separately from the
    current application. For a brand new application, this is equivalent
    to launching the blueprint again. However, a user may have spent
    significant time customizing the existing application to suit their
    specific needs, and would like these changes to be present on the
    new app.
-   The **Snapshot** button creates a new recovery point of the VM,
    which allows a user to restore the VM.
-   The **Launch Console** button opens a console window to the VM.
-   The **Update** button allows for the end user to modify basic VM
    settings (this is equivalent to the **Manage \> App Update**
    action).
-   The **Delete** button deletes the underlying VM and the Calm
    Application (this is equivalent to the **Manage \> App Delete**
    action).

Now that we\'re familiar with the application page layout, let\'s modify
our application by adding additional memory, but let\'s do it in a way
that we can recover from in case something goes wrong.

1.  Click the **Snapshot** button in the upper right, and enter the
    following in the pop-up that appears: change the name to:

    -   **Snapshot Name** - before-update-@@{calm_time}@@ (leave the
        rest as default)

    ![Application Snapshot](images/21_snapshot.png){.align-center}

2.  Click **Save**.

3.  Take note you\'re re-directed to the **Audit** tab. Expand the
    **Snapshot Create** action to view the tasks of the snapshot. Once
    complete, navigate to the **Recovery Points** tab, a validate that
    our new snapshot is listed.

4.  Next, click the **Launch Console** button in the upper right, and
    log in to your VM.

    -   **Username** - centos
    -   **Password** - Nutanix/4u

5.  To view the current memory on CentOS, run the command **free -h**.
    Take note of the current memory allocated to your VM.

    ![CentOS Memory - Before Update](images/22_centos_memory_before.png){.align-center}

6.  Navigate back to the application page of Calm, and click the
    **Update** button in the upper right. On the page that appears,
    increase the **Memory (GiB)** field by 2 GiB (for CentOS, 6 GiB).

7.  Click the blue **Update** button in the lower left.

8.  Validate that the memory field has been increased by 2 GiB, and click **Confirm**.

    ![CentOS Memory - Confirm Change](images/24_centos_confirm.png){.align-center}

9.  In the **Audit** tab of Calm, wait for the **App Update** action to
    complete.

10. Back in the **VM Console**, run the same command from earlier to view the updated memory, and note that it has increased by 2 GiB.

    ![CentOS Memory - After Update](images/26_centos_memory_after.png){.align-center}

If anything went wrong with the VM Update, navigate to the **Recovery
Points** tab, click **Restore** on the **before-update** snapshot we
took earlier, and click **Confirm** on the pop-up.

# Adding your Blueprints to the Marketplace

Now that we know we have a good blueprint, lets publish it to he
Marketplace.

## Publishing the Blueprint

1.  Select ![blueprints](images/blueprints.png) **Blueprints** in the left hand toolbar to view and manage Calm blueprints.

2.  Click your *intials***-CentOS-IaaS** blueprint.

3.  Click the **Publish** button, and enter the following:

    -   **Name** - *initials*_CentOS_IaaS
    -   **Publish with secrets** - off
    -   **Initial Version** - 1.0.0
    -   **Description** - (Optional)

    ![CentOS Publish Blueprint](images/28_centos_publish_bp.png){.align-center}

4.  Click **Submit for Approval**.

    :::note

    Publish with Secrets: By default, the secret values from the
    blueprint are not preserved while publishing. As a result, during
    the launch of the marketplace item, the secret values will either be
    patched from the environment or the user will have to fill them in.

    Set this flag if you do not want this behaviour and you would rather
    the secret values are preserved as is. *Credential passwords/keys and secret variables are considered secret values. While publishing with secrets, these values will be encrypted.*
    
    :::

# Takeaways

What are the key things you should know about **Nutanix Calm** and
**Single VM Blueprints**?

-   Nutanix Calm provides application and infrastructure automation
    natively within Prism, turning complex, week long ticketing
    processes, into one-click self service provisioning.
-   While Multi VM blueprints enable the provisioning and lifecycle
    management of complex, multi-tiered applications, Single VM
    blueprints allows IT to provide Infrastructure-as-a-Service for
    their end users.
-   Common day 2 operations, like snapshotting, restoring, cloning, and
    updating the infrastructure can all be done by end users directly
    within Calm.
